Installing
----------

No binaries yet.

Building
--------

Build as a standard colcon package. There are no special dependencies needed
(use rosdep to resolve dependencies in ROS). 

RUNNING
-------
To run with a params file just run it with
```
ros2 run explore_lite explore --ros-args --params-file <path_to_ros_ws>/m-explore/explore/config/params.yaml
```

### Running the demo with TB3
Install nav2 and tb3 simulation. You can follow the [tutorial](https://navigation.ros.org/getting_started/index.html#installation).
Then just run the nav2 stack with slam:
```
ros2 launch nav2_bringup tb3_simulation_launch.py slam:=true
```

And run this package with
```
ros2 launch explore_lite explore.launch.py
```


#### TB3 troubleshooting
If you have trouble with TB3 in simulation like we did, add this extra steps for configuring it.

```
source /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/setup.bash
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=waffle
sudo rm -rf /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/share/turtlebot3_simulations
sudo git clone https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations /opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/share/turtlebot3_simulations
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:/opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/share/turtlebot3_simulations/turtlebot3_gazebo/models
```
export GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH=$GAZEBO_MODEL_PATH:/opt/ros/${ROS_DISTRO}/share/turtlebot3_gazebo/models


git clone https://github.com/charlielito/slam_gmapping.git --branch feature/namespace_launch

Then you'll be able to run it.
